# dev-blog

dev blog for a game me and a friend are making, no studio name yet
will probably host it as a static site and use strapi locally to make content for now

# why not use wordpress

I want to learn some new things (tailwind, graphql, strapi, etc.) and is mostly the reason why im making a blog site lmao
